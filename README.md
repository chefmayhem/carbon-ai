# Carbon-AI

Welcome to **Carbon-AI**, an open-source tool designed to estimate the carbon impact of software functions in real-time. This fantastic tool empowers developers to make environmentally conscious decisions by providing insights into the carbon footprint of their code.

## Features

- **Real-Time Analysis**: Get immediate feedback on the carbon impact of your software functions, at run-time!  No need to waste time during development, this all runs in the finished code!
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Carbon-AI into your existing development workflow.
- **Open Source**: Modified MIT License for flexibility in deploying this in your own software.
- **Large Language Model Integration**: Use the power of the latest and greatest AI tools available to evaluate your software's carbon footprint.
