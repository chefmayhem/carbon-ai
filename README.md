# Carbon-AI

Welcome to **Carbon-AI**, an open-source tool designed to estimate the carbon impact of software functions in real-time. This fantastic tool empowers developers to make environmentally conscious decisions by providing insights into the carbon footprint of their code.

## Features

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-Time Analysis**: Get immediate feedback on the carbon impact of your software functions, at run-time!  No valuable time needs to be wasted during development, everything happens in real-time when the code is executed.
- üë©‚Äçüíª **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Carbon-AI into your existing development workflow.
- üåé **Open Source**: Modified MIT License for flexibility in deploying this in your own software.
- ü§ñ **Large Language Model Integration**: Use the power of the latest and greatest AI tools available to evaluate your software's carbon footprint.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Based Technology**: Do you have any components of your tech stack which aren't utilizing the power of the cloud?  Just import this library and you can make any function use cloud resources!

## How It Works

Once you've installed the carbon_ai library, and provided a correct API token for OpenAI, then you can use the class to add an
`evaluate_impact` decorator onto any of your functions.  This causes your function, upon being run, to send a copy of itself (the code and the 
arguments) to the OpenAI LLM, where it will handle the heavy lifting of computing the carbon dioxide emissions, in grams CO2, 
that would be generated by that function.  This information will be logged with the logger library, at `INFO` level.

## Getting Started

To get started with Carbon-AI, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/chefmayhem/carbon-ai.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```uhhhhhhh
    ```
3. **Run the Tool**:
    ```uhhhhhhh
    ```

4. **Need to actually write useful things later**
