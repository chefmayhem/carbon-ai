# Carbon-AI

Welcome to **Carbon-AI**, an open-source tool designed to estimate the carbon impact of software functions in real-time. This fantastic tool empowers developers to make environmentally conscious decisions by providing insights into the carbon footprint of their code.

## Features

- ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-Time Analysis**: Get immediate feedback on the carbon impact of your software functions, at run-time!  No valuable time needs to be wasted during development, everything happens in real-time when the code is executed.
- üë©‚Äçüíª **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Carbon-AI into your existing development workflow.
- üåé **Open Source**: Modified MIT License for flexibility in deploying this in your own software.
- ü§ñ **Large Language Model Integration**: Use the power of the latest and greatest AI tools available to evaluate your software's carbon footprint.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud-Based Technology**: Do you have any components of your tech stack which aren't utilizing the power of the cloud?  Just import this library and you can make any function use cloud resources!
